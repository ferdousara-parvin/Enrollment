# Enrollment
This program creates a list that will
 * contain courses by following the linked list format. By reading files that
 * contains courses and their requirements, we are able to determine whether or
 * not a request from a student to enroll in a certain course is possible or
 * not. Later on, we demonstrate the functionality of our custom linked list by
 * showing showing the result of the implementation of all the functions in our
 * class.
